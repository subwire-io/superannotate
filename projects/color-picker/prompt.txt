Input: Create a color selector component with preset color options and custom input.

Response: I'll create a color selector component with preset color options and custom input.
<thinking>

Let me analyze the requirements for this color selector component:

1. The user wants a color selector with preset color options and custom input
2. This should be a simple application with no more than 5 UI elements according to the definition
3. I need to wrap code in CodeProject blocks and implement a complete Next.js solution


For UI elements, according to the definition in the workspace, I'll count:

1. Color display area (to show the selected color)
2. Preset color options (as a group of selectable colors)
3. Custom color input (for manual hex/rgb input)
4. Color format toggle (to switch between hex/rgb display)
5. Copy button (to copy the color value)


This fits within the 5 UI element limit for a simple application.

For the implementation:

- I'll use shadcn/ui components where appropriate
- I'll implement a client component with React state for the color selection
- I'll ensure the component is responsive and accessible
- I'll provide proper color contrast for both the UI and selected colors
</thinking>

I've created a complete color selector component with the following features:

1. Color display area that shows the currently selected color with its value
2. Preset color palette with 21 common color options
3. Custom color input that accepts hex values
4. RGB input fields for precise color adjustments
5. Format toggle to switch between HEX and RGB display modes


The component includes:

- Automatic conversion between HEX and RGB color formats
- A copy button to easily copy the current color value
- Intelligent text contrast (white or black text) based on the selected color's brightness
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Full keyboard accessibility and proper ARIA labels


The implementation is ready for deployment as a Next.js application. You can customize the preset colors or add additional features as needed.
