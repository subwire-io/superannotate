Input: Create a blogging platform interface with post editor, category selection, and publish controls.

Response: I'll create a blogging platform interface with a post editor, category selection, and publish controls.

<Thinking>
To build this blogging platform interface, I need to create several components:

1. Main page layout with the editor interface
2. Rich text editor for content creation
3. Category selection component (dropdown with multi-select)
4. Publish controls including save, draft, and publish options
5. Preview section to show how the post will look

I'll use the following technologies and components:
- Next.js with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Lucide React icons

For the rich text editor, I'll implement a simplified version with basic formatting controls. The state management will handle:
- Post title
- Post content
- Selected categories
- Publishing status
- Publication date (if scheduled)

I'll ensure the UI is responsive, accessible, and includes appropriate loading states.

I've created a comprehensive blogging platform interface with the following features:

1. A clean, responsive layout with editor and preview tabs
2. Rich text editor with formatting controls (bold, italic, lists, quotes, code)
3. Category selection dropdown for organizing blog posts
4. Publish controls with three options: save as draft, publish immediately, or schedule publication
5. Date picker for scheduled publications
6. Live preview tab to see how your post will appear
7. Basic markdown support with simple rendering for the preview
8. Mobile-responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
9. Tips section with writing suggestions
10. Accessibility features including proper labels and ARIA attributes

The interface is built using Next.js with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses shadcn/ui components for a consistent design. The editor provides a streamlined writing experience with basic formatting options while maintaining a clean, distraction-free interface.
