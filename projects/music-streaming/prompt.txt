I'll create a music streaming interface with playlist management, now playing view, and recommendations.

Thought for 7 secondsLet me analyze this task to create a music streaming interface with the specified features:

1. Complexity level: Medium (5-10 UI elements)
2. Required features:

1. Playlist management
2. Now playing view
3. Recommendations





According to the definition of UI elements , a medium UI should have 5-10 distinct, cohesive interactive components. I'll plan the UI elements carefully to stay within this range:

UI Elements I'll include:

1. Navigation sidebar (counts as one element)
2. Now playing bar/player controls (counts as one element)
3. Playlist display area (counts as one element)
4. Search functionality (counts as one element)
5. Recommendations section (counts as one element)
6. User profile/settings access (counts as one element)


This gives us 6 UI elements, which fits within the medium complexity range.

For the component structure:

- I'll create a main layout component
- A sidebar navigation component
- A now playing component
- A playlist management component
- A recommendations component


I'll use shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling. I'll ensure all interactive elements work properly with proper hover states  and follow accessibility best practices.

```typescriptreact project="music-streaming"
...
```

I've created a music streaming interface with the following features:

1. Navigation sidebar with home, search, and recommendations options
2. Playlist management with the ability to view and select different playlists
3. Now playing bar with playback controls, progress slider, and volume control
4. Detailed playlist view showing songs with their details
5. Recommendations view displaying suggested songs
6. Interactive playback functionality (play/pause, next/previous)


The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with clear visual feedback for the current selection and playback state. All buttons and interactive elements function as expected , with proper hover states and accessibility considerations.
