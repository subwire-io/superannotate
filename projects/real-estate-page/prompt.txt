<thinking>

Thought for 8 secondsLet me analyze this task and plan my approach:

1. The user wants a real estate listing page with:

1. Property filters
2. Map view
3. Property cards



2. This should be a medium complexity app with 5-10 UI elements according to the definition.
3. UI Elements I'll include (counting based on the definition provided):

1. Navigation/Header (1 element)
2. Property search/filter system (1 element)
3. Map view (1 element)
4. Property listings/cards section (1 element)
5. Pagination system (1 element)
6. Sort functionality (1 element)
7. View toggle (map/list) (1 element)



4. Component structure:

1. Layout component
2. Header component
3. PropertyFilters component
4. PropertyMap component
5. PropertyCard component
6. PropertyGrid component
7. Pagination component



5. Libraries and tools:

1. Next.js with App Router
2. shadcn/ui components
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. React Leaflet for the map functionality
5. React hooks for state management



6. Data considerations:

1. I'll create a mock data file for property listings
2. I'll implement filtering functionality on the client side



7. Responsive design considerations:

1. Mobile-first approach
2. Responsive layout for different screen sizes
3. Map view that adjusts based on screen size

```typescriptreact project="real-estate-listing"
...
```

I've created a complete real estate listing page with the following features:

1. Property filtering system with price range slider, bedroom selection, and property type filters
2. Interactive map view using React Leaflet to display property locations
3. Property card grid with detailed information about each listing
4. View toggle to switch between grid and map views
5. Pagination system for navigating through property listings
6. Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
7. Mock data with 12 sample properties across different locations and price points


The application follows a medium complexity design with exactly 7 UI elements according to the definition:

- Navigation/Header
- Property search/filter system
- Map view
- Property listings/cards section
- Pagination system
- Sort functionality
- View toggle (map/list)


All components are fully interactive, and the application is built with Next.js App Router, shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
