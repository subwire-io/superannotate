Input: Design a multi-step checkout process with shipping information, payment details, and order review steps.

Response: I'll create a multi-step checkout process with shipping information, payment details, and order review steps.

<Thinking>
For this multi-step checkout process, I need to create a user interface that guides users through completing their purchase. This is a medium complexity task that requires multiple components and state management.

Key components needed:
1. A step indicator showing progress (shipping → payment → review)
2. Form components for each step (shipping address, payment details, order summary)
3. Navigation controls to move between steps
4. State management to track the current step and store form data
5. Order summary component that shows the items being purchased

I'll use the following approach:
- Create a main checkout component that manages the overall state and step transitions
- Use shadcn/ui components like Card, Form elements, and Buttons
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Add proper loading states and validation
- Ensure accessibility with ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

State management:
- Track current active step
- Store form data for each step
- Validation status for each step

I'll structure the code into the following files:
- checkout.tsx (main component)
- components/checkout/checkout-steps.tsx (step indicator)
- components/checkout/shipping-form.tsx (shipping info form)
- components/checkout/payment-form.tsx (payment details form)
- components/checkout/order-summary.tsx (order review component)
</Thinking>

I've created a comprehensive multi-step checkout process with shipping information, payment details, and order review steps. This implementation provides a complete user flow for completing a purchase.

The checkout process includes:

1. A step indicator showing the user's progress through the checkout flow
2. Shipping information form with address fields and country selection
3. Payment details form with credit card information fields
4. Order review page showing order items, shipping information, and payment method
5. Navigation controls to move between steps (Previous/Next buttons)
6. Form state management to maintain user inputs across steps
7. Responsive design that works well on all screen sizes
8. Visual feedback showing the current active step
9. Order summary with itemized list, quantities, and price calculations

The implementation uses modern React patterns with hooks for state management and follows best practices for form handling. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling, creating a clean and professional checkout experience.
