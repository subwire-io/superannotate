Input: Design a user profile card showing avatar, name, job title, and a follow button.

Response: I'll create a user profile card showing avatar, name, job title, and a follow button.
<Thinking>
For this task, I'll create a clean, professional user profile card with the following elements:
1. Avatar/profile image
2. User's name
3. Job title
4. Follow button with interactive state
I'll use shadcn/ui components for the card structure and button, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The layout will be responsive and follow accessibility best practices with proper semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes.
Since this is a simple UI component (less than 5 UI elements), I'll keep it focused on just these requirements without adding unnecessary complexity.

I've created a clean, modern user profile card component with the following features:

A circular avatar with image support and fallback to user initials
User's name displayed prominently with proper typography
Job title shown below the name in a muted color for visual hierarchy
An interactive follow button that toggles state when clicked
Optional skill badges to provide additional context

The component is fully responsive and follows accessibility best practices including:

Semantic HTML structure
Proper contrast between text and background
ARIA attributes for the interactive button
Alt text for the avatar image

The design uses shadcn/ui components for consistency and Tailwind CSS for styling. The profile card includes sensible defaults but also accepts props for customization, making it reusable across different contexts in your application.
