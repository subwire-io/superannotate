Response: I'll create a comprehensive e-commerce dashboard with order management, inventory tracking, customer analytics, and sales reports.
<Thinking>
For this comprehensive e-commerce dashboard, I need to structure a complete application with multiple interconnected components:

Main Layout

Sidebar navigation
Header with user profile and notifications
Main content area


Dashboard Overview Page

Sales overview cards
Recent orders table
Revenue charts
Top selling products


Order Management

Orders table with filtering and pagination
Order detail view
Order status management


Inventory Tracking

Product list with stock levels
Low stock alerts
Product category breakdown


Customer Analytics

Customer demographics charts
Customer activity metrics
Customer acquisition chart


Sales Reports

Revenue over time charts
Sales by category
Sales by region
Export functionality



I'll use shadcn/ui components for a consistent modern UI, Lucide icons for visuals, and implement mock data for demonstration. For charts, I'll use the recharts library which is compatible with shadcn/ui.
The dashboard should be fully responsive and follow best accessibility practices with semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and screen reader support.

I've created a comprehensive e-commerce dashboard with multiple interconnected components. Let me summarize what I've implemented:

A complete layout with responsive sidebar navigation and header
Dashboard overview with key metrics, charts, and recent orders
Order management system with filtering and status tracking
Inventory tracking with stock management and alerts
Customer analytics with demographic data and key metrics
Sales reports with various visualizations and export functionality
Interactive data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
Beautiful charts and visualizations for data analysis
Mock data generation for realistic demonstration

The dashboard includes:

Real-time stats cards showing key business metrics with trend indicators
Revenue charts with daily, weekly and monthly analysis
Product performance tracking with category breakdowns
Low stock alerts for inventory management
Customer retention and acquisition metrics
Sales analytics with regional and category breakdown
Export functionality for generating reports
Responsive design that works on all device sizes

All components use shadcn/ui for consistent styling, with proper accessibility features including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. The UI follows modern design principles with clean typography, proper spacing, and intuitive navigation.
