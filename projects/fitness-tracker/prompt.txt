Response: I'll create a comprehensive e-commerce dashboard with order management, inventory tracking, customer analytics, and sales reports.
<Thinking>
For this comprehensive e-commerce dashboard, I need to structure a complete application with multiple interconnected components:

Main Layout

Sidebar navigation
Header with user profile and notifications
Main content area


Dashboard Overview Page

Sales overview cards
Recent orders table
Revenue charts
Top selling products


Order Management

Orders table with filtering and pagination
Order detail view
Order status management


Inventory Tracking

Product list with stock levels
Low stock alerts
Product category breakdown


Customer Analytics

Customer demographics charts
Customer activity metrics
Customer acquisition chart


Sales Reports

Revenue over time charts
Sales by category
Sales by region
Export functionality



I'll use shadcn/ui components for a consistent modern UI, Lucide icons for visuals, and implement mock data for demonstration. For charts, I'll use the recharts library which is compatible with shadcn/ui.
The dashboard should be fully responsive and follow best accessibility practices with semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and screen reader support.
