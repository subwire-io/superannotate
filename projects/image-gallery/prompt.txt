</Thinking>

I've created a simple image gallery component with thumbnail previews and a main image display. The implementation includes:

A main image display area that shows the currently selected image
A row of thumbnail images that can be clicked to select and display in the main area
Previous and next navigation buttons for cycling through the images
Optional captions that display below the main image when available
Responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
Proper accessibility features including ARIA labels and roles
Visual indicators showing which thumbnail is currently selected
Smooth transitions with hover effects on interactive elements

The gallery is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into any Next.js application. The component accepts an array of image objects containing the necessary information (source, alt text, and optional caption).
The demo implementation shows how to use the component with placeholder images, but you can replace these with your actual image URLs.
