Input: Build a healthcare patient portal with appointment scheduling, medical records, prescription management, and doctor messaging.

Response: I'll create a comprehensive healthcare patient portal with the requested features.

<thinking>For this healthcare patient portal, I'll need to create several components and pages to support the requested features:

1. Main structure:

1. Layout with sidebar navigation
2. Dashboard page as the main entry point

2. Feature components:

1. Appointment scheduling calendar and booking flow
2. Medical records viewer with categorized sections
3. Prescription management with refill requests
4. Doctor messaging interface

3. Design considerations:

1. Clean, accessible healthcare UI with clear information hierarchy
2. Mobile responsive design for accessing on various devices
3. Secure data handling patterns (using server components where appropriate)
4. Clear status indicators for appointments, prescriptions, etc.

4. Libraries and tools:

1. Shadcn UI components for the interface
2. Tailwind for styling
3. React server components for data handling
4. Form handling for appointment booking and messaging

I'll structure the code in a logical order, starting with shared components, then feature-specific components, and finally putting them together in page files.

I've created a comprehensive healthcare patient portal with all the requested features:

1. Dashboard with health summary, upcoming appointments, medication reminders, and recent activity
2. Appointment scheduling system with calendar view and appointment management
3. Medical records section with categorized health documents and download options
4. Prescription management with medication tracking and refill request functionality
5. Secure doctor messaging interface with real-time chat capabilities
6. Responsive sidebar navigation that works on mobile and desktop
7. Patient profile with ID information


The portal uses a clean, accessible design optimized for healthcare applications with clear information hierarchy and status indicators. All components are fully responsive and use Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling.
