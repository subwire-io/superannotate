<Thinking>
For this dashboard, I need to:

Create a responsive layout with multiple widgets:

Weather widget showing current conditions, temp, location
Recent activities widget showing user actions with timestamps
Quick actions widget with common tasks
Additional complementary widgets (messages, stats, quick access)


Include proper functionality:

Dark/light mode toggle
Dropdown menus for user profile and actions
Tabbed content
Status indicators for activities


Design considerations:

Consistent use of shadcn/ui components
Card-based layout with appropriate spacing
Mobile-responsive grid
Accessibility features (ARIA attributes, proper labels)
Visual hierarchy and organization


Implementation details:

Mock data for weather, activities, and messages
Helper functions for conditional rendering
State management for theme toggle
Icon usage from Lucide React
</Thinking>

I've created a comprehensive dashboard with multiple widgets that includes:

A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Weather widget displaying current conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
Recent activities feed showing user actions with timestamps and status indicators
Quick actions panel with four common tasks represented as large buttons
Messages widget showing recent conversations with timestamps
Stats overview with key metrics and trend indicators
Quick access widget with tabbed interface for files and links
Dark/light mode toggle with proper theme application
User profile dropdown menu and notification button

Additional features:

Proper accessibility implementation with ARIA attributes and screen reader text
Type-safe component structure with TypeScript interfaces
Responsive grid layout that adjusts column count based on screen width
Mock data for realistic presentation
Status indicators with color-coded badges
Card-based UI with consistent styling using shadcn/ui components

The dashboard provides a clean, modern interface that gives users quick access to important information and frequently used actions. The layout is designed to be scannable, with each widget focused on a specific purpose, making it easy for users to find what they need.
