Input: Build a progress indicator that shows steps completed in a multi-step process. 

Response: <thinking>
I'll create a simple progress indicator for a multi-step process.

Thought for 6 secondsFor this task, I need to create a progress indicator that shows completed steps in a multi-step process. The user has specified that it should have no more than 5 UI elements to fall under the simple complexity category.

Let's analyze what UI elements we need:

1. The progress indicator itself (visual representation of progress)
2. Step labels/titles
3. Current step indicator
4. Navigation buttons (previous/next)
5. Step content container


For the implementation approach:

- I'll create a client component since we need interactivity
- I'll use React state to track the current step
- I'll implement a clean, accessible design with proper ARIA attributes
- I'll ensure the component is responsive
- I'll use shadcn/ui components where appropriate


The component will need to:

- Display the current step and total steps
- Show visual progress (completed vs. remaining steps)
- Allow navigation between steps
- Clearly indicate the active step


I'll keep the design minimal but effective, focusing on the core functionality while ensuring it meets accessibility standards.

1. Visual progress indicator showing completed and remaining steps
2. Step labels with clear indication of the current active step
3. Step content display area showing the current step's information
4. Navigation controls (previous/next buttons) with appropriate disabled states
5. Completion handling with an optional callback function


The progress indicator is fully interactive and responsive, with a clean design that clearly shows the user's progress through a multi-step process. The component accepts an array of steps, an optional initial step, and an optional completion callback. I've kept it under 5 UI elements as requested, focusing on the core functionality while maintaining a good user experience.
