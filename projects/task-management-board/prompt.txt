I'll create a task management board with columns for 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done' with the ability to add tasks to each column.

Thought for 7 secondsLet me analyze this task and plan my approach:

1. UI Elements needed (aiming for medium complexity with 5-10 elements):

1. Navigation/Header (1 element)
2. Task board with three columns (1 element)
3. Task cards (1 element)
4. Add task form/modal (1 element)
5. Task detail view/modal (1 element)
6. Column header with task count (1 element)
7. Search/filter functionality (1 element)
8. Task priority indicator (1 element)



2. Component structure:

1. Main layout component
2. Board component
3. Column component
4. Task card component
5. Add task modal/form
6. Task detail modal



3. State management:

1. I'll use React's useState and useContext for state management
2. Need to track tasks, their status, and any editing operations



4. Features to implement:

1. Create new tasks
2. Move tasks between columns (drag and drop)
3. Edit task details
4. Delete tasks
5. View task details
6. Search/filter tasks



5. Libraries to use:

1. Next.js with App Router
2. shadcn/ui components
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop functionality





Let me create the necessary files for this project.
