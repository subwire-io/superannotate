I'll create a recipe finder application that allows users to filter recipes by cuisine type and dietary restrictions, displaying results in a card layout.

<Thinking>
For this medium complexity recipe finder, I need to create:

1. Main Layout:
   - Search bar for recipe keywords
   - Cuisine type dropdown filter
   - Dietary restrictions filter (multiple checkboxes)
   - Results display area with recipe cards

2. Components:
   - Recipe card component to display individual recipes
   - Filter section component for managing all filters
   - Results section to display filtered recipes

3. Data & State:
   - Mock recipe data with cuisines and dietary information
   - State management for filters and search terms
   - Filtering logic to combine multiple filter criteria

4. UI Elements (ensuring 5-10 for medium complexity):
   - Search input
   - Cuisine dropdown
   - Dietary restriction checkboxes (considered as a group)
   - Recipe cards with images
   - Recipe details section
   - Filter/reset buttons

5. Styling & Accessibility:
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
   - Proper ARIA attributes for filters and interactive elements
   - Visual indicators for applied filters
</Thinking>

I've created a comprehensive recipe finder application with multiple filtering options. The application includes:

1. A search bar to find recipes by title or description
2. A cuisine type dropdown filter with multiple options (Italian, Indian, Mexican, etc.)
3. Dietary restriction filters with checkboxes (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free)
4. Recipe cards displaying images, titles, descriptions, and preparation times
5. Visual badges indicating cuisine type and dietary restrictions
6. Applied filters display with easy removal options
7. A responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
8. Clear filter options both individually and collectively
9. Empty state handling when no recipes match the filters

The application implements proper accessibility features including ARIA attributes, semantic HTML elements, and proper focus management. The filters work together, allowing users to combine search terms with cuisine selection and multiple dietary restrictions.

The mock data includes a diverse set of recipes with varying cuisines and dietary profiles. In a real-world implementation, you could easily replace the mock data with API calls to fetch recipes from a backend service.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail or make any adjustments to the design?
