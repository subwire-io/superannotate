Input: Build a comprehensive HR management system with employee profiles, attendance tracking, performance reviews, and recruitment pipeline.

Response: <Thinking>This is a complex web UI creation task that requires multiple components and interactions. I'll need to create a comprehensive HR management system with several key features:

1. Employee profiles
2. Attendance tracking
3. Performance reviews
4. Recruitment pipeline


This falls into the "Complex Web UI" category (10-15 UI elements with interactions) as it will require multiple tabs, forms, tables, and interactive elements.

I'll structure the application with:

- A main dashboard layout with navigation
- Separate sections for each major feature
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Interactive components for data entry and visualization
- Mock data for demonstration purposes


For the UI components, I'll use:

- Shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React icons for visual elements
- Next.js App Router for navigation


I'll implement the following UI elements (10-15 elements):

1. Navigation sidebar
2. Dashboard overview cards
3. Employee profile cards/details
4. Attendance calendar/tracker
5. Performance review forms
6. Performance metrics charts
7. Recruitment kanban board
8. Job posting form
9. Candidate profile cards
10. Search and filter components
11. Notification system
12. Settings panel


Let me plan the file structure:

- app/

- layout.tsx (main layout)
- page.tsx (dashboard)
- employees/

- page.tsx (employee list)
- [id]/page.tsx (employee profile)



- attendance/

- page.tsx (attendance tracking)



- performance/

- page.tsx (performance reviews)



- recruitment/

- page.tsx (recruitment pipeline)



- components/

- dashboard/
- employees/
- attendance/
- performance/
- recruitment/
- ui/ (shared UI components)
