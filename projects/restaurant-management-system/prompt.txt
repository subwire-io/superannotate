Input: Create a complete restaurant management system with table reservations, menu management, order taking, and kitchen display.

Response: 'll create a complete restaurant management system with all the requested features.

<thinking>
For this restaurant management system, I need to create a comprehensive solution that includes:

1. **Authentication System**: For staff logins with role-based access
2. **Table Reservation System**: To manage bookings and table availability
3. **Menu Management**: For adding, editing, and organizing menu items
4. **Order Taking Interface**: For waitstaff to take and manage orders
5. **Kitchen Display System**: For kitchen staff to view and manage orders
6. **Dashboard**: For overview and analytics


I'll structure this with:

- Next.js App Router for routing
- Shadcn/UI for components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Server Components and Client Components where appropriate
- TypeScript for type safety
- Local state management with React hooks
- Server Actions for database operations


For database models, I'll need:

- Users (staff members with roles)
- Tables (for restaurant layout)
- Reservations (bookings)
- Menu Categories
- Menu Items
- Orders
- Order Items


I'll use a modular approach to make the code maintainable and extensible.

I've created a comprehensive restaurant management system with the following features:

1. Authentication system with role-based access control for different staff members
2. Dashboard with key restaurant metrics including revenue, orders, and reservation stats
3. Table management interface with status tracking and capacity information
4. Reservation system for booking tables with comprehensive customer information
5. Menu management with categories, items, pricing, and availability control
6. Order management system for servers to input customer orders quickly
7. Kitchen display system showing food preparation status in real-time
8. Staff management portal for adding and managing employees with different roles
9. Interactive interfaces with grid and list views for various management screens
10. Responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices


The system uses Next.js with the App Router, React Server Components, and Shadcn/UI components for a modern UI. It includes mock data for demonstration purposes, which could be easily connected to a real database in production.
