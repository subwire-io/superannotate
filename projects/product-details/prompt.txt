Input: Build a product details page with image carousel, specifications tab, reviews tab, and add to cart functionality.

Response: I'll create a product details page with image carousel, specifications tab, reviews tab, and add to cart functionality. <Thinking> For this product details page, I'll build a comprehensive UI with multiple components:

Main components needed:

Image Carousel Product Information Section Tabs component (Specifications, Reviews) Add to Cart functionality

Structure:

Layout: Main product page with sections for different components Carousel: For displaying multiple product images Product Info: Title, price, description, and configuration options Tabs: To toggle between specifications and reviews Cart functionality: Quantity selector and add to cart button

State management:

Active tab state Carousel current image state Product quantity state Cart interaction states

Libraries/Components:

Use shadcn/ui for UI components (Tabs, Button, Card) Lucide React for icons Tailwind for styling

Technical considerations:

Responsive design for different screen sizes Accessible navigation for tabs and carousel Loading states and image handling

</Thinking> I've created a comprehensive product details page with the following features:
Interactive image carousel with thumbnails for easy navigation Detailed product information section with title, rating, price, and description Color selection with visual indicators for the currently selected option Quantity selector with increment/decrement buttons Add to Cart button with alert confirmation Tabbed interface for Specifications and Reviews sections Technical specifications displayed in a clean, organized layout Customer reviews section with ratings, dates, and comments Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

The page implements all the requested functionality while maintaining a clean, modern design using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling. The product data is currently mocked but could easily be replaced with data from an API or database. The interface includes proper accessibility attributes for navigation elements and interactive components. All functionality is implemented with React hooks for state management, making it easy to extend or modify the behavior as needed.
