Input: Design a job board with search functionality, filters for job type and location, and job card listings.

Response: <Thinking>
This is a medium complexity project requiring me to create a job board interface with several features:

Search functionality for jobs
Filters for job type and location
Job card listings

I'll design a responsive job board UI using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.
Component Structure:

Main JobBoard component
SearchBar component for job search
FilterSection for job type and location filters
JobList to display job cards
JobCard to display individual job listings

UI Elements (5-10 for medium complexity):

Search input
Job type filter (dropdown)
Location filter (dropdown)
Job cards (displaying title, company, location, etc.)
Clear filters button
Pagination controls
Sort options
Save/bookmark job button

Data Structure:
I'll use a mock data structure for jobs with fields like:

id
title
company
location
description
jobType (full-time, part-time, contract, etc.)
salary
postedDate
skills/requirements

State Management:

Search query state
Filter states (job type, location)
Loading state for job results
Pagination state

Functionality:

Search by job title/keyword
Filter by job type (full-time, part-time, contract)
Filter by location
Clear all filters option
Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

This seems like a complete job board interface that fits the medium complexity requirements.

I've created a comprehensive job board interface with search functionality, filters, and job card listings. Here's what's included:

Job search functionality with real-time filtering
Job type filter (Full-time, Part-time, Contract)
Location filter with auto-populated options
Interactive job cards with detailed information
Active filter indicators with easy removal
Responsive pagination system
Empty state handling when no jobs match filters
Bookmark functionality for saving interesting jobs

The interface is fully responsive and designed with accessibility in mind, including proper ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support. The job board features a clean, modern design using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
The implementation includes:

Mock job data with realistic fields (title, company, location, etc.)
State management for search queries and filters
Real-time filtering based on user input
Pagination to handle large numbers of job listings
Clear visual feedback when filters are applied

This job board provides a solid foundation that could be extended with additional features like saved job collections, application tracking, or integration with a real job API.
