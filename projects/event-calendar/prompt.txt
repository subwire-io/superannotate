Input: Create a calendar display showing events by day and a modal form for adding new events

Response:  <Thinking> This task requires me to build a medium-complexity event calendar with the following key components:

Calendar display showing events by day Modal form for adding new events Event management (viewing, adding)

The structure I'll need includes:

Main calendar component with grid/day view Event display components within calendar cells Modal component with form for adding events State management for events and modal visibility Date handling utilities

I'll use the following libraries/components:

shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Dialog, Form elements) Lucide React for icons date-fns for date manipulation React hooks for state management

For accessibility:

Proper labeling of interactive elements Keyboard navigation Appropriate ARIA attributes Screen reader text where needed

The UI flow will be:

User sees calendar with current month displayed Events appear within their respective day cells User can click "Add Event" button to open modal User fills event details and submits form New event appears on calendar

Let me implement this with clean, maintainable code. </Thinking>

I'll create a ready-to-deploy event calendar using Next.js based on the provided code and requirements.

Thought for 5 seconds```typescriptreact project="event-calendar"
...
```

I've created a ready-to-deploy event calendar application using Next.js with the following features:

1. Monthly calendar view with navigation controls
2. Day cells that display events with color-coding by category
3. Modal form for adding new events with title, date, time, category, and description
4. Event categorization (Personal, Work, Meeting, Social, Other)
5. Visual indicators for today's date and selected days
6. Responsive design with proper accessibility attributes
7. Tooltips for event details on hover
8. Category legend for easy reference


The application is structured with clean component separation and follows best practices:

1. Type definitions for events and categories
2. Reusable components for calendar parts (days, header, event items)
3. State management for events and UI interactions
4. Proper date handling with date-fns
5. Accessibility features including ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation


You can deploy this application directly to Vercel or any other hosting platform that supports Next.js.
