Input: Build a video conference UI with participant grid, chat sidebar, and meeting controls.

Response: I'll create a video conference UI with a participant grid, chat sidebar, and meeting controls.

<Thinking>
For this medium-complexity video conferencing UI, I need to build:

1. Layout structure - A main layout that divides the screen into video area and chat sidebar
2. Participant grid - A responsive grid of video participants that adapts to different screen sizes
3. Chat sidebar - A collapsible sidebar with message history and input field
4. Meeting controls - A control bar with buttons for audio, video, screen sharing, etc.

Component structure:
- Main video conference component (container)
- ParticipantGrid component
- ParticipantCard component for individual video feeds
- ChatSidebar component
- MeetingControls component

I'll use shadcn/ui components like Button, Card, Input, Separator and others, plus Lucide icons for the various controls. I'll mock the data for participants and chat messages since this is a UI implementation.

Key considerations:
- Responsive design that works on different devices
- Accessibility for all interactive elements
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Loading states and error handling
- Dark/light mode compatibility

I've created a comprehensive video conference UI with the following features:

1. A responsive participant grid that displays video feeds and adapts to different numbers of participants
2. A collapsible chat sidebar with message history and the ability to send new messages
3. Meeting controls including audio toggle, video toggle, screen sharing, and leave call options
4. Screen sharing layout that prioritizes the shared screen while showing participant thumbnails
5. Mobile-responsive design with a collapsible chat that works well on smaller screens
6. Status indicators for audio and video states of each participant
7. Accessibility features with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
8. Dark mode compatibility throughout the interface

The UI includes the main components:
- A primary video conference container that manages the layout and state
- ParticipantGrid component to display video feeds with proper layout handling
- ParticipantCard component for individual video displays
- ChatSidebar component with message history and input field
- MeetingControls component with buttons for call functionality
